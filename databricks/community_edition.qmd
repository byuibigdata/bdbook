## What is the difference between the Databricks Community Edition and the full Databricks Platform?

> With the Databricks Community Edition, the users will have access to 15GB clusters, a cluster manager and the notebook environment to prototype simple applications, and JDBC / ODBC integrations for BI analysis. The Databricks Community Edition access is not time-limited and users will not incur AWS costs for their cluster usage.

> The full Databricks platform offers production-grade functionality, such as an unlimited number of clusters that easily scale up or down, a job launcher, collaboration, advanced security controls, and expert support. It helps users process data at scale, or build Apache Spark applications in a team setting.
